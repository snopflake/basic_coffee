# WORKSHOP FE MOBILE - Flutter Animation 🌠

# Basic Coffee Redeem 🍵

A simple Flutter app that lets users “redeem” virtual tokens for delicious coffee items. Tap any card to animate a fill effect when you have enough tokens, or shake the card if you don’t — all while tracking your token balance in real time.

## Features

- **Animated Fill**: Smooth left-to-right fill animation on successful redemption  
- **Shake Feedback**: Card shakes on insufficient tokens  
- **Token Balance**: Live counter that decreases when you redeem  
- **Customizable**: Easily swap out coffee items, colors, durations, and icons  
- **Clean UI**: Rounded cards, smooth transitions, and Inter font via Google Fonts  

## Getting Started

1. **Clone** the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic_coffee.git
   cd basic_coffee
